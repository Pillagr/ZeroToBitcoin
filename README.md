Help going from Zero Knowledge to Understanding Bitcoin (Not Comprehensive)

This Guide will contain docs that will either directly explain aspects of Bitcoin or provide resources that do the same. The guide is split into the following docs:

<h2>Intro to Bitcoin</h2>



<h2>Bitcoin-Technical</h2>


<h2>Bitcoin Resources</h2>
Includes videos, podcasts, documentaries, and websites dedicated to teaching Bitcoin. 


<h2>PowerPoints</h2>
Some PowerPoints, not created by myself, but taken from presentations and twitter.
